# Snowline Data Sources

This document outlines potential sources for historical snowline data, which is derived from snow cover information. The primary focus for this project is Scotland, UK.

## Primary Source for Scotland

*   **Snow Survey of Great Britain (SSGB):** This is the most promising source for historical data.
    *   **Description:** Contains daily snow observations from 140 sites across Scotland from 1945-2007. The paper records have been digitized.
    *   **Availability:** The data is available from the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and the Met Office archives.
    *   **Pros:** High-resolution, long-term dataset specific to the region of interest.
    *   **Cons:** The dataset ends in 2007. More recent data will need to be sourced from satellite imagery.

## Satellite Data (for more recent data)

*   **National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC):** Provides a long-term (1966-present) dataset of snow cover duration based on satellite imagery.
    *   **Pros:** Longest continuous record. Good for data post-2007.
    *   **Cons:** Coarse resolution (100-200km cells), so it's best for large regions.

*   **Rutgers University Global Snow Lab:** Produces snow cover maps used in climate change indicators by the US EPA.
    *   **Pros:** High-quality, reliable data.
