# Snowline Data Sources

This document outlines potential sources for historical snowline data, which is derived from snow cover information.

## Satellite Data

*   **National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC):** Provides a long-term (1966-present) dataset of snow cover duration based on satellite imagery.
    *   **Pros:** Longest continuous record.
    *   **Cons:** Coarse resolution (100-200km cells), so it's best for large regions (e.g., countries, mountain ranges).
    *   **Link:** [https://nsidc.org/](https://nsidc.org/)

*   **Rutgers University Global Snow Lab:** Produces snow cover maps used in climate change indicators by the US EPA.
    *   **Pros:** High-quality, reliable data.

## Weather Station & Gridded Data

*   **NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration):** Offers historical snowfall and snow depth data for thousands of cities, primarily in the United States.
    *   **Pros:** Can be used to interpolate snowlines for specific areas.
    *   **Cons:** Data is point-based, not a continuous map.
    *   **Link:** [https://www.noaa.gov/](https://www.noaa.gov/)

*   **Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS):** Provides real-time and historical snow and climate data, including snow water equivalent (SWE) from SNOTEL sites.
    *   **Pros:** Detailed data for mountainous regions of the Western US.
    *   **Cons:** Limited geographic coverage.
    *   **Link:** [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/)

*   **U.S. Forest Service:** Offers historical and future snow trend data, such as snow residence time and April 1st SWE.
    *   **Pros:** Useful for analyzing long-term trends in US National Forests.
    *   **Cons:** Limited geographic coverage.
